 This directory contains the configuration interface. In order to be able to save settings, you
 must make the following files writable by your webserver:

 /site.settings.php
 /css/style.css

 You may decide not to copy this directory to your webserver, if you don't need it. The contact
 form works without it, but you need to set the recipient email address manually 
 in site.settings.php if you wish not to use the configuration interface.
